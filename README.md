This is a basic Python script designed to demonstrate the successful setup of the Python development environment and the use of standard output functions.

Code Breakdown:
print() Function: The core of the script is the print() function, which is used to display the text "Hello World" (or your specific message) to the console.

String Literals: The message is enclosed in quotes, defining it as a string data type in Python.

Execution Flow: The script follows a linear execution, running from the top down to process the output command instantly when executed via the terminal.
